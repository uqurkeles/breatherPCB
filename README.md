# breatherPCB

breatherPCB is an Altium project made for developing skills and getting used to the electronics environment for me.

The project includes an ATMEGA328P-AU microcontroller. In addition to the ICSP pin, CH340G is added to be able to code on ArduinoIDE.

The aim of this project is to trigger two n-channel MOSFETs according to an I2C sensor output to control elements such as relays. 
In order to have different voltage levels, an LDO and also a Buck Converter are designed.
